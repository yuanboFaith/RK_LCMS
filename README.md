## UHPLC-QqQ-MS/MS method development and validation with statistical analysis: Determination of raspberry ketone metabolites in mice plasma and brain

This work (see [original article](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32474352/) published in J. Chroma. B) developed and validated a novel LC/MS method for raspberry ketone (a natural compound with potential use for body weight control) in mice plasma and brain tissues. The data anaysis is performed in R. The script and output can be accessed [here](https://yuanbofaith.github.io/RK_LCMS). The R script has reference to the [tidyverse documentation](https://www.tidyverse.org/) and [**DataBrewer.co**](https://www.databrewer.co/).
